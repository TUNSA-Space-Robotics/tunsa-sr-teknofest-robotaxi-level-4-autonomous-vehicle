## Introduction

This project, undertaken for the TEKNOFEST Full-Scale Autonomous Vehicle 2022 Competition by TUNSA Space Robotics, aimed to develop a cutting-edge autonomous vehicle capable of navigating inner-city traffic with level 4 autonomy. Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies, the project sought to achieve robustness, reliability, and efficiency in autonomous transportation systems.

## Project Scope

Spanning from March 7, 2022, to May 20, 2022, the project involved a meticulously planned and executed effort led by Elyes Khechine, comprising a multidisciplinary team of 13 members. The primary objective was to conceptualize and design a full-scale autonomous robotaxi adhering to stringent traffic regulations. The project culminated with a detailed 53-page preliminary design report that was written within a tight 3-week timeframe, outlining the vehicle's architecture, systems, and proposed methodologies. We were able to achieve a 70% score in the preliminary round of the TEKNOFEST competition.

## Key Features

- **Advanced GNSS Module Selection**: Identification and adoption of the UMSZ6 Series GNSS module for high-accuracy positioning, offering precise localization within 50cm without correction data and ensuring robust performance in diverse satellite environments.
- **Optimized IMU Selection**: Rigorous assessment led to the selection of the Ellipse-E inertial navigation sensor for its superior gyroscopes, effective vibration handling, and reliable RTK position maintenance during GNSS signal loss scenarios.
- **Stereo Camera Setup for Visual Perception**: Cost-effective deployment of a stereo camera setup for visual perception, enabling real-time depth perception and facilitating level 4 autonomy functionalities.
- **Hybrid Sensor Fusion Architecture**: Proposal of a hybrid sensor fusion framework to enhance real-time SLAM tasks, addressing challenges in sensor synchronization, raw data processing, and noise mitigation for critical system parameters.
- **NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Pegasus VCU Integration**: Evaluation and integration of the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Pegasus Developer Kit for its exceptional processing power, comprehensive sensor compatibility, and robust toolset for autonomous vehicle development.
- **Advanced Mission Planning Algorithms**: Thorough analysis and selection of mission planning algorithms such as hybrid A*, RRT, and RRT-A*, with adoption of Advanced BIT* for potentially faster planning speeds and reduced computation costs.
- **Behavioral Planning Methodology**: Evaluation and adoption of behavior trees for behavioral planning, leveraging modularity, maintainability, scalability, and reusability advantages for efficient autonomous decision-making.
